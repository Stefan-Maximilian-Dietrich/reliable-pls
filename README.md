# *In all Likelihoods*

## Introduction, Table of Contents
This repository contains implementation, results and experimenal scripts for reliable Pseudo-Label Selection, as introduced in the paper "In all Likelihoods: How to Reliably Select Pseudo-Labeled Data for Self-Training in Semi-Supervised Learning". More specifically,

* [R](R) contains implementation of multi-model PLS, multi-lable (wieghted and unweighted) PLS and alternative PLS methods to benchmark against
* [benchmarking](benchmarking) provides files for experiments (section 5), in order to reproduce results, see setup below
* [data](data) contains real-world data used in experiments
* experimental results and visualization thereof will be saved in [plots](plots) and [results](results) 
* all results can be found in [plots](plots) 
* In order to reproduce experiments, please read **setup** further below
